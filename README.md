I'm a graduate in Media and Cultural Studies 🎓 from Nottingham Trent University 🏛. 

I joined Simply Business **15** years ago. I worked for 7 years in various customer facing roles, then for a further 5 years as a Technical Solutions Consultant, before joining Insurance Product as an Insurance Product Technician in November 2019.

Since then I pushed **850**+ commits, and submitted **a bunch of** pull requests, which is nice.
